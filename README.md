## About

**Wire** is a small reactive wrapping for [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework,
highly inspired in [Cycle.js](cycle.js.org) (the web development framework) and it's fractal state
management, [onionify](https://github.com/staltz/cycle-onionify).

Wire allows you to take advantage of the awesomeness of LÖVE in a fully
reactive and delightfull way. No global variables all around, no imperative
actions, no mixed concerns (interaction, logic, side-effects, etc).

You just need to wire everything up **declarativelly** and let the data flow
freely throughout your game.


## Installation
