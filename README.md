# About

**Wire** is a small reactive wrapping for [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. 
It allows you to use all the awesomeness of LÖVE in a fully 
reactive and delightfull way. 

You just need to wire everything up **declarativelly**, and 
let the data flow freely throughout your game.

More info coming soon. :hourglass:
